would create extensive changes to the constitution, including recognition of Quebec as a distinct society.', 'However, the agreement was defeated by a large margin in a national referendum in October 1992.', ""Many blamed the GST battle and Mulroney's rising unpopularity for the fall of the Accord."", ""The end of the Meech Lake Accord in 1990 created division in the country and sparked a revival of Quebec separatism, culminating in the creation and rise of the Bloc Quebecois (BQ).In foreign policy, Mulroney opposed the apartheid regime in South Africa and he met with many of the regime's opposition leaders throughout his tenure."", 'His position put him at odds with the American and British governments, but also won him respect elsewhere.', 'He led the Western response to the

tax increase, but a tax shift, the highly visible nature of the tax was extremely unpopular, and many resented Mulroney\'s use of an ""emergency"" clause in the constitution.', 'Fiscal conservatives likewise did not approve of Mulroney\'s tax increases and his failure to curtail expansion of ""big government"" programs and political patronage.', ""This caused a stark decline in Mulroney's

between the federal and Quebec Government.', 'In 2006, he was proclaimed Canada’s greenest prime minister by a survey of environmentalists, due to his efforts such as the Canada-U.S. acid rain treaty,

would create extensive changes to the constitution, including recognition of Quebec as a distinct society.', 'However, the agreement was defeated by a large margin in a national referendum in October

of Quebec separatism, culminating in the creation and rise of the Bloc Quebecois (BQ).In foreign policy, Mulroney opposed the apartheid regime in South Africa and he met with many of the regime's opposition leaders throughout his tenure."", 'His position put him at odds with the American and British governments, but also won him respect elsewhere.', 'He led the Western response to the

tax increase, but a tax shift, the highly visible nature of the tax was extremely unpopular, and many resented Mulroney\'s use of an ""emergency"" clause in the constitution.', 'Fiscal conservatives likewise did not approve of Mulroney\'s tax increases and his failure to curtail expansion of ""big government"" programs and political patronage.', ""This caused a stark decline in Mulroney's
